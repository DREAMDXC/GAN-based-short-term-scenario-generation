基于条件生成对抗网络的可再生能源日前场景生成方法[J].中国电机工程学报,2020,40(17):5527-5536.

### Note: 

This program is not the original program of the manuscript, but the realization of the function is the consistent.
CGAN is used to generate short-term temporal-scenarios by inputting short-term forecast values. 
It is suitable for a variety of time series data scenario generation tasks such as wind, PV, and load.
